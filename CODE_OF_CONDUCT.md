# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as a community support not being a dick. Any form of politics, hatred or toxicity towards one another is considered being a dick.

## Our Standards

Just don't bring your personal issues, politics, ideologies or anything outside of the technical space into the Viperd community. We understand people can not always get along, but this is no reason to bring or make anything personal.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Viperd owners and maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Viperd community spaces, and whatever is done and acted with *outside* of the Viperd community has no bearing on the standing within the community. 
We do not see reason to block or revoke ones access to the space just because a person is connected to others that are not part of the Viperd community. We only do not tolerate inside noise towards our members or contributors in anyway, 
what you do on Discord, Twitter or anything else privately or not affiliated with us is not our responsibility or burden to bear.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### Don't be a dick
For real, we as a community do not care for political or personal debate. We are here for technical understanding, growth and to build software.

If you for some reason decide to make anything political, this will have consequences and the severity of this will be determined on frequency and context of the situation.

To re-iterate: just be a software person, enjoy the process and keep things technical and professional.
