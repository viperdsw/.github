## Viperd CoC

This Code of Conduct serves to do nothing but state the obvious.

1. Keep politics out of Viperd as an organisation, or any Viperd projects.

2. Don't be a dick, or at least don't be a dick on purpose.

3. No active or targeted harassment towards anyone or anything.

4. Keep ANY politics out. Re-iterating this because some people really can not read.
